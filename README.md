# ChrispyWebsite

### *The personal website of Christopher Johnson*

---

## Purpose:

The main purpose of this sits is to offer a more in-depth showcase of my strengths, skills, and qualifications than is seen on my resume. Since it's possible to update this site at any time, it's the most up to date source of information about me.

It is a showcase for my portfolio, containing my best work in a single, easily accessible place. Not only that, but it's also *a part* of my portfolio. It showcases my programming and design skills, as well as my ability to problem solve.

## Technical Details:

This site is built with React 18.3.1, which makes it fast, flexible, and easy to update. I chose to work with React for those reasons, but also because I was interested in learning a new web platform; React seemed like a good choice.

Along with React, this site also uses jQuery 3.7.1 to add and remove certain elements from the page. I chose to use jQuery for this to showcase my ability to use multiple JavaScript technologies.
